# Work Day Scheduler 
README 


## Description

USER STORY:
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

The motivation to build this workday scheduler was to learn how to use web apis using js, html and css
this scheduler gives you time slots and you can input your schedule into each slot
if you navigate away from the page the information that has been entered still stays
the scheduler will also tell you the future time in green, and any present events in red and past in gray
